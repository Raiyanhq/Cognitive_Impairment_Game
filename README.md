Cognitive Impairment Game

This is a simple memory game built using Python and the Pygame library. The game consists of a 4x4 grid of cards, where the player clicks on two cards to reveal them. If the cards match, they stay visible. The goal is to match all pairs of cards.

How to Play

Click on a card to reveal its image.
Click on another card to try and find a match.
If the cards match, they remain visible. If not, they flip back over after a brief delay.
The game ends when all pairs are matched.

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

You can install Pygame by running:

# pip install pygame

How to Run

- Clone the repository.
- Make sure you have the required card images (e.g., card1.png, card2.png, etc.) in the same directory as the Python script.
